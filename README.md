Both assignments require installing aquery.

## Homework 1
Given a schema ticks(ID, date, endofdayprice) find the maximum and minimum return of each stock where return is the ratio of the price of day i compared with the price of day i-1.
Example of this query:
   ticks(ID, date, endofdayprice)
   s1, 1, 10
   s2, 1, 100
   s1, 2, 13
   s2, 2, 200
   s1, 3, 10
   s2, 3, 150
   s1, 4, 15
   s2, 4, 140
Max return for s1 is 15/10.
Min return for s1 is 10/13.
Max return for s2 is 200/100
Min return for s2 is 150/200.
